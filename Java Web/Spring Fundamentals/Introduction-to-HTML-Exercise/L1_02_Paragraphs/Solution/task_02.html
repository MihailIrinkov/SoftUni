        Principles For Clean HTML Code
    </h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Beautiful and clean HTML</strong> is the foundation of a beautiful website. When I teach people about <strong>CSS</strong>,
        I always begin by telling them that good CSS can only exist with equally good HTML markup.
        A house is only as strong as its foundation, right? The advantages of <strong>clean, semantic HTML</strong> are many,
        yet so many websites suffer from poorly written markup.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Strict DOCTYPE</strong>. If we are going to do this, let’s just do it right. No need for a discussion about whether to use HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0:
        both of them offer a strict version that will keep us nice and honest as we write our code.
    </p>

    <p>
        Character set & encoding characters. In our &lthead&gt section, the very first thing should be the <strong>declaration</strong> of our character set. We’re using <strong>UTF-8</strong> here,
        which is swell, but it’s listed after our &lttitle&gt. Let’s go ahead and move it up so that the browser knows what character set it’s dealing with before
            it starts reading any content at all.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next time you write <strong>HTML</strong>, be it a small chunk in a huge website, or the beginning of a fresh new project, just do what you can to make it <strong>right</strong>.
