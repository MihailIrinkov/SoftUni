                        that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which
                        you may have seen appear on parts of your web
                        browser): HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The
                        markup (formatting) language for the web. URI:
                        Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address”
                        that is unique and used to identify to each resource
                        on the web. It is also commonly called a URL. HTTP:
                        Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the
